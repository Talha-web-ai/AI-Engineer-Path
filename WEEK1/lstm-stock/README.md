# 📈 Day 4 – LSTM Stock Price Prediction

This project demonstrates how to use **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for **time-series forecasting**.  
Instead of relying on real stock APIs (which can be slow and inconsistent), this notebook uses **synthetic stock price data** to quickly showcase how an LSTM model can learn and predict sequential patterns.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict stock prices using an LSTM model.
- **Dataset:** Synthetic stock data generated with a mix of trend + seasonality + noise.
- **Model:** Multi-layer LSTM with dropout regularization.
- **Evaluation:** Compare model predictions vs. true values on unseen test data.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Time-series preprocessing for supervised learning.
- Scaling and reshaping data for LSTM input format:  
  *(samples, time_steps, features)*.
- Building deep learning models with **TensorFlow/Keras**.
- Visualizing predictions vs. actual prices.

📊 Results
The model learns the underlying trend and seasonality of the synthetic stock prices.
Below is an example visualization comparing true values vs. predicted values:

💡 Learning Takeaways
LSTMs capture sequential dependencies, making them ideal for stock/time-series tasks.

Even with synthetic data, LSTM can generalize trends and fluctuations.

This framework can be easily extended to real-world stock data using APIs like yfinance.



🔮 Next Steps
Replace synthetic data with real stock data (e.g., Apple, Tesla) using yfinance.

Experiment with hyperparameter tuning (layers, units, epochs).

Extend to multi-feature inputs (volume, moving averages, technical indicators).

Deploy model via Flask / FastAPI for real-time stock predictions.
